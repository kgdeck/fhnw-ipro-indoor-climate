### Use the Microbit with MakeCode
Here's an [introduction to the Microbit](https://github.com/tamberg/microbit-intro) with [MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org).

- Find your [Microbit device](https://makecode.microbit.org/device) and USB cable at home
- Open the editor https://makecode.microbit.org/
- Connect the Microbit to your computer via USB
- Download the .hex file to the "MICROBIT" drive
- Wait for the Microbit's LED to stop blinking
  
### Read a value from an I2C sensor
On an embedded device, connected via USB.

#### With MakeCode (on Microbit)
- Plug the Microbit into the Grove adapter.
- Wire the sensor to the Grove port named _I2C_.
- Open _Extensions_, search for / select a library, e.g. [Grove](https://makecode.microbit.org/v1/pkg/Seeed-Studio/pxt-grove).
- Check for new blocks matching the sensor name, e.g. _SCD30_.

### Write ASCII bytes to a serial port
On an embedded device, connected via USB.

#### With MakeCode (on Microbit)
Use the _Advanced_ > [Serial](https://makecode.microbit.org/v0/reference/serial) blocks to write strings and numbers.

#### Result
ASCII data is sent over USB serial.

### Read ASCII bytes from a serial port
On your computer, with a device connected via USB.

#### With _screen_, in a terminal (on MacOS, Linux)
```console
$ screen /dev/tty.u<TAB> 115200
```
(To end _screen_ press CTRL-A-K.)

#### With _PuTTY_ (on Windows)
- Install [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
- Select the _Session_ tab
- Select _Connection type: Serial_
- Edit _Serial line: COM3_
- Select _Speed: 115200_
- Click _Open_ to connect

#### With Python
Install the [pyserial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shortintro.html) library.
```console
$ pip uninstall serial
$ pip install pyserial
```
Edit [serial_read.py](Python/serial_read/serial_read.py) to set the serial port name.
```Python
import serial

port = serial.Serial('/dev/tty.usbmodem102') # or 'COM3'
port.baudrate = 115200
while (port.isOpen()):
    bytes = port.readline()
    chars = str(bytes, 'utf-8')
    print(chars)
```

Run the program.
```console
$ cd level-1/Python/serial_read
$ python serial_read.py
```

#### With Java
Edit [Program.java](Java/serial_read/src/main/java/Program.java) to set the serial port name.
```Java
public final class Program {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        ...
    }
}
```
Run the program.
```console
$ cd level-1/Java/serial_read
$ ./clean.sh && ./setup.sh && ./build.sh
$ java -cp ./src:target Program
```

#### Result
ASCII data sent over USB shows up, e.g.
```console
(485.480316162109)
(485.607025146484)
(485.632629394531)
...
```

#### Errors
Got an error? Check these tips.

- Python [AttributeError: module 'serial' has no attribute 'Serial'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41199876/attributeerror-module-serial-has-no-attribute-serial)
- Terminal _permission denied: ./script.sh_
    ```console
    $ chmod u+x *.sh
    ```
- Terminal broken after using _screen_
    ```console
    $ stty sane
    ```

### Store data in CSV format into a file
Sensor data sent from the Microbit via USB/Serial should be saved as a CSV file so it can be analyzed later.

- Choose a programming language (e.g., Python or Java) that can read data from the serial port.
- Open/create a file with the .csv extension in your program.
- Write each measurement line in the format _Timestamp,CO2_Value into the file.
- Close the file when the program ends.

Python example
```console
import serial, time, csv

port = serial.Serial('/dev/tty.usbmodem102', baudrate=115200)
with open('data.csv', 'a', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Timestamp", "CO2"])
    while True:
        line = port.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        writer.writerow([time.time(), line])
```

### Open a CSV file as a spreadsheet
View the saved CSV data in a spreadsheet program such as Excel or Google Sheets.

- Open Excel, LibreOffice Calc, or Google Sheets.
- Import the CSV file.
- Select comma as the delimiter.
- Check if the columns are correctly separated.

### Store data into a database with SQL
Import CSV data into a relational database to enable more complex queries.

- Install a local database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).
- Create a table:
```console
CREATE TABLE climate_data (
    timestamp REAL,
    co2 REAL
);
```
- Import the CSV data or write directly to the database from your program (e.g., with Python’s sqlite3 module).
```console
import sqlite3, time

conn = sqlite3.connect('climate.db')
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute("INSERT INTO climate_data VALUES (?, ?)", (time.time(), co2_value))
conn.commit()
```

### Read data from a database with SQL
Retrieve, filter, and sort stored data.

- Open your database tool or use SQL directly.
- Run a query:
```console
SELECT timestamp, co2 FROM climate_data
WHERE co2 > 1000
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```
- Export the result as CSV for visualization if needed.

### Run a database as a local service
Keep the database running in the background as a service so you can insert/query data anytime.

## Side quests
To learn more, consider these side quests.

- [ ] Show a "bad room climate" alert on the Microbit
- [ ] Add other [available sensors](https://github.com/fhnw-imvs/fhnw-iot-library/tree/main), e.g. light or PIR
- [ ] Replace your computer with a Raspberry Pi
